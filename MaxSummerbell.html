  <h2><u>Personal statement</u></h2>
  Personal statement: I have always believed that you can achieve anything you want with enough<br>
	hard work and determination and this is the work ethic that I have carried with me all through my<br>
	time at school, college and hope to continue it into my time at university and the workplace. I<br>
	believe this is the reason that I achieved the maximum grade of D*D*D* in my BTEC.<br>
	<p></p>
	During college I took charge of my learning and studied a lot of the topics outside of college such as<br>
	programming in C# and games development. I enjoy working as part of a team, tackling challenging<br>
	tasks and trying to find the best solution to different problems. I enjoy learning new skills and then<br> 
	applying them to my existing work to expand my knowledge and broaden what I am capable of<br>
	doing.

  <h2><u>Skills</u></h2>
  <p>Excellent IT skills -  While my main experience is with programming in different languages such as C#,<br>
	java and MySQL, I also have experience in different aspects of IT. For example, I have built my own<br> 
	personal PC and have built 2 different PC’s for friends. I also have extensive experience in<br>
	troubleshooting.
	<br>
	<br>
	Development technologies – During my time at college I learnt and coded primarily in C# using Visual<br>
	Studios and both command line applications as well as Windows Form applications. I also<br>
	complimented this by learning the Unity Game Engine both in my own time and for my game project<br> 
	in year two. I also learnt HTML and CSS and applied both to make several websites and also towards<br>
	making my own personal website.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Communication skills – My communications skills have developed a lot through college as I was<br>
	helping class mates with their work and partaking in group discussion frequently. This extended to<br> 
	University when I collaborated with other students from various courses on a group project in our<br>
	own time. This taught me to communicate effectively, clearly and to bounce ideas around a group.<br>
	Personal skills – Punctuality, strong desire to learn new skills and have new experiences, willing to<br> 
	adjust to different conditions and environments.</p>
	<h2>Work expirence</h2>
	<p>Sales assistant at WHSmiths during August 2011

	communication in a professional environment, solving customer’s problems in the best way possible<br> 
	for them as well as self-organisation and presentation skills. It also taught me how to handle<br>
	customer who might have a variety of needs and requests.</p>
